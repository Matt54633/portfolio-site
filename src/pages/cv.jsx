          Outside of my work, I enjoy cooking with friends and family and reading books on a wide
          array of subjects. Iâ€™m also passionate about researching emerging technologies, often
          through building personal projects and using new frameworks. I also remain committed to
          volunteering, a value instilled in me during my time with the Scouting Association.
