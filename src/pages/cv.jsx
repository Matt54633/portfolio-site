          Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and trying new recipes with friends and family. Iâ€™m
          passionate about keeping up with emerging technologies, often through building personal
          projects, exploring new frameworks, and reading technical books. I also remain actively
          committed to volunteering, a value instilled in me through my time with the Scouting
